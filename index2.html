  <p>Coastal
    Coastal is the perfect style for those who want to bring the beach and ocean into their daily lives. It incorporates color schemes of white, blue, green, and orange. Accessories include framed ocean reefs, sea shells, wood elements, and casual furniture to create a relaxing atmosphere.
    
    Modern
    Modern design is a sleek style that highlights simplicity. Decorators utilize white, gray, and black as main color schemes. Designs are clean and non-cluttered. Straight and bold lines are preferred. Natural accessory elements and materials are used, such as wood frames, metal decor, and furniture.
    
    Contemporary
    Contemporary is a softer variation of modern design. It's often confused with modern because it also features a clean appearance with straight lines. It allows for bold, soft, and neutral colors. Contemporary is different from modern design because its style is always changing. It focuses on designs and trends of the present; what defines contemporary design today may not define it in the future.
    
    Modern Glam
    Modern Glam elegantly merges contemporary and modern design. Upholstered tufted chairs and ottomans adorn these spaces with luxury feeling fabrics, like velvet. Metallic furniture and accessory pieces are commonly used and paired with bright or neutral color schemes. Soft touches are encouraged, such as white roses in a classic vase. Other features like chandeliers, large mirrors, ruffled materials, and jeweled objects add sophisticated and classy touches.
